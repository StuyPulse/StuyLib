StuyLib is a collection of tools commonly and or uncommonly used in robot code.
The point of this library is to have a standard library for these tools that are
maintained separetly from the robot code. Because these tools are core tools, it
is important that any changes not be made as a requirement for a new robot arises.
This includes, importing robot code, robot dependant constants, and any other 
changes that could just be added to the robot instead.


## Where to find the .jar files

You can find all the .jar files on the [release page](https://github.com/StuyPulse/StuyLib/releases).

## Rules for Code Submission

As is standard for most Git Repos, you must make a branch and then create a pull request. 
A pull request may be merged by any of the project managers at any time. The list of managers
may be seen in the list down below.

Code should preferably contain java docs for each function, but exceptions can be made for
functions in which the name is self explanatory. 

Each class should contain a comment that gives a description for what each class does,
along with an author tag that serves 2 purposes:

 - Flex that you wrote a class
 - Allows people to ask you questions in the future

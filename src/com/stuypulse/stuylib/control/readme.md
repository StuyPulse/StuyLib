# StuyLib Control Library

A rudimentary control theory library designed to create controllers using feedback, feedforward, and signal processing algorithms.

## TODO

* document
* add `FeedbackController` to make feedback controllers nicer to adapt
* test, test, test
* test feedforward (can use values from [recalc](https://www.reca.lc/))
* graphs
* integrate with logging nicely
* test classes like `VelocityMotor` and `PositionMotor`
* add MORE/BETTER ways to compose controllers (upgrade `InlineController`?, what other ways can controllers be composed)

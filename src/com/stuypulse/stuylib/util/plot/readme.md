# StuyLib Plotting Library

A simple library for plotting streams and filters. Wraps [Knowm's XChart library](https://knowm.org/open-source/xchart/).

## todo

* document how to use this library
* the scale of plots can be changed from [0, 1] but time series are stuck between [0, 1]
* random errors from XYChart
* cannnot turn off duration (may want to draw forever?)
* change where chart settings are stored / handled
